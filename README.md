# Halley

## Foreword
Halley is a project for anyone who wants to add electronic effects to the crib.

Its first version dates back to 2016 and was created using Arduino Uno and then improved over the years with its own dedicated board that was fitted with an ATMega 328 microcontroller.

Currently the electronic part is still at the 2017 version in which there is a card with ATMega 328 that drives 6 IRL power mosfets and an MP3 module for sound reproduction.
The firmware part, on the other hand, is constantly evolving to allow greater flexibility on different types of cards.
